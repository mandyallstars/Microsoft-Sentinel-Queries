// Use these queries to estimate EPS and Cost from different log sources
// Microsoft Sentinel provides 3 build in workbooks for EPS, Cost and Usage calculations and these are:
// 1. Data collection health monitoring
// 2. Microsoft Sentinel Cost
// 3. Workspace Usage Report
// However, these workbooks do not breakdown the log sources within Syslog and CEF (Common Event Format)
// which makes it hard to estimate cost for specific log source sending logs in one of these formats.
// Examples include: Oracle databases sending Syslog format logs, CEF logs from Checkpoint or Tipping Point

// Estimating EPS for a specific Oracle database server sending logs in syslog format
Syslog
| where Computer contains "Oracle"
// keep in mind that Syslog messages from other oracle servers may contain the name of your database. add more filters to go more granular if required
| where SyslogMessage contains "<oracle-instance>" //replace <oracle-database> with the specific Oracle instance of your interest
| summarize count() by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1s)
| summarize avg(count_) by Computer

// Estimating Cost for specific Oracle database server sending logs in syslog format
// this is calculating cost over 7 days and then projecting that estimate over a year. Actual cost may vary and this is just for estimation purposes
Syslog
